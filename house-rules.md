#House Rules (Work in Progress)

+ **Whilst you're a student, arrive on time & let people know in advance if you're going to be away**. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.
+  **Tidy up after yourself** (at least!). With so many of us in the space, it's easy for the kitchen area to get dirty really quickly - wash up your crockery rather than forgetting about it in the sink and wipe down the counter area you've been using it and we'll all be a lot happier :blush:
