#Before you you arrive

### Get a laptop

If you do not yet have a laptop, get one. If you want something inexpensive, a ChromeBook with at least 4GB of RAM is a good option.

### Set up a dev environment

Get your computer set up for software development. We are going to be spending a lot of time working on the command line. 

If you have a Mac, you are more-or-less ready to go. 

If you have a ChromeBook, you will want to install Linux, using [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton). If you want help, then just google [crouton](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=crouton). There are several decent tutorials out there.

If you have a Windows PC, you may want to consider also installing Linux on it. It can be a bit of a pain, but is probably preferable (at least, in our experience) to trying to work with Windows. Good luck.

### Get familiar with the command line

If you don't know anything about the command line, then try Zed Shaw's [CLI Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/).

### Learn the basics of HTTP

Here's a [pretty good introduction](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/HTTP_Basics.html).

### Git

Work through our [Introduction to Git and Version Control](https://github.com/NataliaLKB/learn-git-basics).
