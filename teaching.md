#Teaching at Founders & Coders [Work in Progress]
At Founders & Coders, _each week is led by a different group of people_ (depending on their expertise and chiefly on their availability).     
We operate as a **collaborative learning environment** encouraging students to try new (to them) things, teach each other and rapidly iterate. We do a lot more **providing direction** and a lot less **teaching/lecturing** than a traditional classroom environment.    

**This is a collection of our thoughts on what has worked so far when teaching and is intended mainly as a resource for people leading any given week of the course**.

###General structure
Each week requires:
+ **1 or 2 people to lead the week** - this doesn't mean they do all the work, it just means that there is someone to make sure that there is an established structure for the week (for anything outside of the routine tasks) and things are running [on schedule](/schedule.md)
+ **3-4 people to be role mentors**, one for each group (this can include the person leading the week)
+ **3-4 people to be clients** on weeks where this is required

###Role Groups
Originally we carried the same 4 role groups from week to week, but we have found it best to have **different role groups from week to week, according to the key knowledge required to form a solid foundation for that week**.   
Each group has a mentor who:
+ Explains the task for 5-10 minutes in the morning (for testing, this is more involved and in the first week may require a full day's collaborative teaching)
+ Checks in withe the role groups throughout the day to field questions and re-direct learning if they wander too far off track.

###General tips
When asked a question:
+ What did you google for?
+ Have you asked the other members of your team?
+ Have you asked other students outside of your team? [If you know a team that has worked through the same problem, point them to that team]
