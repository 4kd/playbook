# MVP projects

After completion of the foundation course, students can continue with a further period of study, consisting of four projects completed over up to eight weeks.

Each project will consist of a complete minimum viable product (MVP). The first round of MVPs can be for the students' own projects or will be suggested by us. [Subsequent projects](http://foundersandcoders.org/mvp) will usually be for external clients of potential employers.

##Guidelines

### Project selection

+ After a project is posted on the MVP projects board, students can add their names to it.
+ We generally recommend teams of 2-4, with 3 usually being the ideal number.

### Before starting

The client will be expected to complete a project questionnaire, that should alert the team to all the major issues that they will need to address both before and during the project. [in preparation]

### Process

+ Each project will normally start on a Monday.
+ Projects will last for two weeks (athough later projects may be completed over one week, if preferred)
+ Each team will use PivotalTracker to manage the project.
+ Each team will appoint a trainer to train the client in using PivotalTracker.
+ Each project will consist of two one-week sprints.
+ The client will be invited to join the team on the first Monday to agree the scope of the project and to participate in a sprint planning meeting.
+ The client will be invited to join the team on the second Monday for a sprint review and planning meeting.
+ The client will be invited to join the team for a project review on the final day of the project.

### Communication

+ Each project team will appoint a team lead, who's job it will be to communicate with the client throughout the project.
+ It is up to the team lead to arrange meeting times with the client.
+ It is up to the team lead to notify the client of any changes to schedule or personnel.
+ It is up to the team lead to delegate any of these tasks if they are not available to carry them out.
+ It is the responsiblity of all team members to notify their colleagues of any changes to their own availability.

### Documentation

+ Each team will maintain a GitHub repository for the project with a README.
+ Unless the client requests otherwise, the repo will be public. (But the repo and the README should usually not refer to the client by name to give their project some sort of anonymity.)
+ No sensitive client information should be included in the repo.
+ Each team will complete a screencast for the client to accompany the README, describing the project and how to install and use it.

### Pay

On successful completion of a project, all income received for these MVPs will be divided equally between the students. It is the responsibility of students to raise their own invoices.

### On completion of four projects

After completion of four projects graduate developers may decide to prepare their submission to the apprentice panel. They can also continue to work on MVP projects, as they become available.

We also encourage graduates to continue with any follow-up work for the client after the completion of an MVP.
